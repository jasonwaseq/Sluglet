Sluglet is a comprehensive student housing marketplace web application specifically designed for UC Santa Cruz students. Built with Next.js, React, and PostgreSQL, the platform enables students to browse, create, and manage off-campus housing listings through an intuitive, responsive interface. The application features advanced search and filtering capabilities including location-based search with Google Maps integration, price range filtering, property type selection, bedroom count, availability dates, and amenities filtering. Users can create detailed listings with multiple image uploads, drag-and-drop functionality, and comprehensive property information including contact details, availability dates, and amenity selections.
